**About**
  
BindIt is a tool to facilitate the creation of Java bindings in Ruby. It provides:

* a simplified interface to load JARs that automatically manages paths
* an interface to pre-load and dynamically load classes into a Ruby namespace 
* an utility functions on Rjb objects, such as Ruby iterators

BindIt uses the Ruby-Java-Bridge (Rjb) to access Java objects. It runs on Ruby 1.9.2 and 1.9.3.
